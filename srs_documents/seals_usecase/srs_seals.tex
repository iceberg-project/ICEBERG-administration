\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to capture the requirements of the ICEBERG: Seal
Use Case. It will include functional, non-functional and User Interface requirements.
It will be used as the reference document between the RADICAL Team and the Stony 
Brook team for the Seals use case development.

\section{Document Conventions}
The requested features are listed in section 4 and the non-functional requirements are
listed in section 5. Each of these requirements have a priority from the set {HIGH,
MEDIUM, LOW}. Based on the number of requirements and their priority, a timeline
will be created with each requirement and its expected time-to-completion.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
%$<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, 
%such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and 
%documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is 
%organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the 
%overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to 
%each reader type.$>$

The document is edited and iterated between users and developers. It is intended
to provide the developers as well as the project managers a complete understanding 
of the requirements as they are expected by the users.

An early use case document is provided in [1]. The current status of the project is
provided by the use case Github repository [2].

\section{Project Scope}
\iffalse
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, 
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to 
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document 
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$
\fi
We provide a detection algorithm to extract the location of seals from high-resolution imagery.  This algorithm was developed by convolutional neural network training to detect and count seal haul-outs.   This is beneficial, as a comprehensive pack-ice seal census and monitoring will provide key information on the health and evolution of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
\iffalse
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$
\fi
ICEBERG is a multi-disciplinary, cyberinfrastructure, integration project to (1) develop open source image classification tools tailored to high-resolution satellite imagery of the Arctic and Antarctic to be used on HPDC resources, (2) create easy-to-use interfaces to facilitate the development and testing of algorithms for application specific geoscience requirements, (3) apply these tools through four use cases that span the biological, hydrological, and geoscience needs of the polar community, (4) transfer these tools to the larger (non-polar) EarthCube community for continued community-driven development.

\section{Product Functions}
\iffalse
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\end{figure}

The main functions of the Seals pipeline are tiling, detection, counting, and reporting the location of seals in a set of images.

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
\iffalse
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$
\fi
\begin{itemize}
	\item Community users - Will use a web interface to access the capabilities of ICEBERG
	\item Expert users - Will use ICEBERG via command line interface to execute experiments and their use cases.
	\item Developers - Are users that are able to develop additional pipelines and/or change/update existing pipelines. They will be able to use the CLI or directly the resource interfaces.
\end{itemize}

\section{Operating Environment}

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
\iffalse
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$

messages will be displayed via the web or command line interfaces.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$
